Plugins for QuakePlugins

These are plugins written in Lua or C# that are designed to run on [QuakePlugins](https://github.com/jpiolho/QuakePlugins).

**I might not keep this repo up-to-date so there's no guarantee that they're in working order with the latest version of QuakePlugins.**

## How to install a plugin
1. Place the plugin folder in your `rerelease/_addons/` folder.
2. Run the game or change the map.
